Use Octave a free application to run the project.
Install octave from:   https://wiki.octave.org/GNU_Octave_Wiki
Use OCTAVE_CLI command line to run the script files.
Use the scripts ex1.m and ex1 multi.m to do the housing predictions for dataset 1 and dataset2.

1) ex1.m
ex1.m uses linear regression to predict profits for a food truck. The problem is to predict the profit for openning a new resturant in a new city by using linear regression.
DataSet contain the population of different cities and their corresponding profit.

2) ex1-multi.m
Predicting the price of houses using linear regression.
The dataset2 contains features such as house size and nnumber of bedrroms. Normalization is required to normalize these features, cause the number of bedrooms is a number between 0-10, while the size is from a bigger range.

1) ex1.m
ex1.m uses linear regression to predict profits for a food truck. The problem is to predict the profit for openning a new resturant in a new city by using linear regression.
DataSet contains the population of different cities and their corresponding profits.

2) ex1-multi.m
Predicting the price of houses using linear regression.
The dataset2 contains features such as house size and number of bedrooms. Normalization is required to normalize these features, cause the number of bedrooms is a number between 0-10, while the size is from a bigger range.
